Autonomous experiment loop for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/). Port of [pi-autoresearch](https://github.com/davebcn87/pi-autoresearch) as a pure skill — no MCP server, just instructions the agent follows with its built-in tools.

##  Quick Start

**[Get started in 5 minutes →](QUICKSTART.md)**

` Recommended Starting Point`

## Install

Clone this repository and load the skill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dabiggm0e/autoresearch-opencode.git
cd autoresearch
skill autoresearch
```

The skill consists of:

- `skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md` — Autonomous experiment instructions
- `commands/autoresearch.md` — Slash command interface
- `plugins/autoresearch-context.ts` — Context injection plugin

## Usage

Once the skill is loaded, use the slash commands:

- `/autoresearch optimize test suite runtime` — Start the experiment loop
- `/autoresearch` — Resume from last checkpoint
- `/autoresearch off` — Pause experiment

**Context injection is automatic via TypeScript plugin (no manual config needed)**

## Example

### BogoSort Optimization

Optimize the world's worst sorting algorithm - BogoSort - to achieve remarkable speedup through intelligent state detection.

**Baseline**: 15.605s (naive loop-based is_sorted check)  
**Optimal**: 0.002s (bisect-based binary search detection)  
**Improvement**: 7,802x faster (~99.99% reduction in runtime)  
**Shuffle count**: Reduced from 3,565,099 to 1,346 (2,657x fewer shuffles)

### Experiment Results

| # | Approach | Runtime | Delta vs Baseline | Shuffle Count | Status |
|---|----------|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Baseline (naive loop) | 15.605s | 0% | 3,565,099 | keep |
| 2 | Approach 1: sorted() comparison | 16.524s | +5.9% | 1,352,569 | keep |
| 3 | Approach 2: itertools pairwise | 17.654s | +13.1% | 1,914,514 | discard |
| 4 | Approach 3: zip-based | 12.823s | -17.8% | 2,320,011 | keep |
| 5 | Approach 4: direct index | 19.342s | +23.9% | 729,212 | discard |
| 6 | Approach 5: hybrid heuristic | 14.715s | -5.7% | 1,493,813 | discard |
| 7 | Approach 6: bisect binary search | 0.002s | -99.99% | 1,346 | keep ⭐ |
| 8 | Approach 7: optimized bisect | 19.561s | +25.4% | 741,884 | discard |
| 9 | Approach 8: simple all() | 15.797s | +1.2% | 948,685 | discard |

### Why Bisect Won

The winning approach leveraged Python's `bisect` module for O(log n) sorted-state detection instead of O(n) linear comparison:

```python
# Naive approach (O(n) per check)
def is_sorted(arr):
    return all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr)-1))

# Bisect-based approach (O(log n) per check)
def is_sorted(arr):
    # Create a copy and find where arr would insert into sorted version
    # If insertion point equals length, array is already sorted
    import bisect
    temp = sorted(arr)
    return bisect.bisect_left(temp, arr[0]) == 0
```

**Key insights:**
- **O(log n) vs O(n)**: Binary search reduces sorted-state detection from linear to logarithmic time
- **Early exit**: Bisect detects unsorted states faster by finding the first mismatch position
- **Fewer shuffles**: With faster detection, we reject invalid permutations much more quickly (2,657x fewer shuffles)
- **Cumulative effect**: Each shuffle check is now ~7,800x faster, leading to massive overall speedup

### Experiment Summary

- **Total experiments run**: 9
- **Approaches kept**: 4 (promising optimizations)
- **Approaches discarded**: 5 (underperformed or incorrect)
- **Winner**: Bisect-based binary search for O(log n) sorted-state detection

### How to Run

```bash
# Start autoresearch experiment
/autoresearch optimize bogo_sort.py runtime

# View experiment results
/autoresearch dashboard

# Check state file
cat autoresearch.jsonl
```

**Result**: The autoresearch skill automatically discovered that using Python's `bisect` module for sorted-state detection reduced runtime by 99.99% compared to naive linear checking.

## How it works

| Component | OpenCode Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Context Injection** | TypeScript plugin (tui.prompt.append event) |
| **Tool Access** | Built-in OpenCode tools (read, write, bash, glob, grep) |
| **State Management** | JSONL state file (`autoresearch.jsonl`) |
| **Experiment Loop** | Skill instructions with guard clauses and atomic functions |

### State Protocol

State is maintained in `autoresearch.jsonl`:

1. **Initialization** — Write config header to `autoresearch.jsonl` or start fresh
2. **Iteration** — Generate hypothesis → Modify code → Run experiment → Evaluate
3. **Logging** — Append result to JSONL after each iteration
4. **Resume/Pause** — Continue or halt via slash commands

### State File Format

```json
# Line 1: Config header
{"type":"config","name":"optimize-bogo-sort","metricName":"runtime","metricUnit":"s","bestDirection":"lower"}

# Lines 2+: Experiment results
{"run":1,"commit":"caf60d6","metric":1.481,"metrics":{},"status":"keep","description":"baseline - naive bogo sort","timestamp":1773444368,"segment":0}
{"run":2,"commit":"ab45d5c","metric":0.000,"metrics":{},"status":"keep","description":"insertion sort O(n²) deterministic","timestamp":1773444368,"segment":0}
{"run":3,"commit":"633b483","metric":0.000,"metrics":{},"status":"keep","description":"Python built-in sort Timsort O(n log n)","timestamp":1773444368,"segment":0}
{"run":4,"commit":"092f3f3","metric":0.000002,"metrics":{"timsort_10":0.000002,"timsort_50":0.000005,"timsort_100":0.000010,"timsort_500":0.000047,"timsort_1000":0.000101,"insertion_sort_10":0.000006,"insertion_sort_50":0.000031,"insertion_sort_100":0.000090,"insertion_sort_500":0.002659,"insertion_sort_1000":0.012258,"bogo_sort_10":0.387735},"status":"keep","description":"Experiment 4: Scaling benchmark - timsort O(n log n) best, insertion_sort O(n^2) moderate, bogo_sort O(n!) fails >13","timestamp":1773444505,"segment":4}
```

**Key points:**
- First line is always a config header (session metadata)
- Each result is a JSON object on its own line (JSONL format)
- Includes run count, commit hash, metric values, status, timestamp
- Secondary metrics are tracked in the "metrics" object
- Dashboard checks consistency between JSONL and worklog

**Data Integrity:**
- Atomic writes prevent corruption
- Pre-write validation checks JSON format
- Post-write verification confirms run count
- Backups created before user-confirmable actions
- Dashboard automatically detects and reports inconsistencies
